## NÃ­ck

Hello, there! I am NÃ­ckolas de Aguiar Alves (he/him), a theoretical physicist. I am a PhD student at the Federal University of ABC. I work in the interface between quantum mechanics and gravitation. My interests are focused on general relativity, quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and general aspects of quantum gravity.

A lot of information about me and my work is available on [my website](https://alves-nickolas.github.io/). Across the remaining repositories in my GitHub you will be able to find a few parallel works. Most of them are LaTeX templates I wrote for personal use and chose to make available.
